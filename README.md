# Epoll
Epoll is an API that allows monitoring multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible on any of them. So it basically waits for some event on a file descriptor. If it is “ready”, say for a read operation, then it can be performed without blocking. It can be used as an edge-triggered or level-triggered interface and scales well to large number of file descriptors. Note that edge-triggered API notifies the application only when changes occur on the monitored file descriptor. So there is a risk of blocking indefinitely if you read partial data from read file descriptor and the file descriptor was blocking. So you should be careful with using edge-triggered mode for epoll. Read the man pages to know more.
